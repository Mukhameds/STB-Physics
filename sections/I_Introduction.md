### I. Introduction

#### 1.1. The Crisis of Physics: Mass Without Origin, Time Without Cause

Modern physics relies on quantities that are extensively used in equations but lack a causal origin within the theories themselves. This creates a logical crisis: the formulas work, but they fail to explain **why** physical properties emerge.

---

### I. Mass as a Non-Triggered Variable

Einstein’s formula:



E = mc²



defines the equivalence between mass and energy, but **does not explain how mass arises**.

In the Standard Model, particle mass is attributed to interaction with the Higgs field, but:

- It is not defined what excites the Higgs field;
- There is no signal condition: `S ⇒ m`;
- Mass appears without a trigger, without any external input.

> Therefore, mass is treated as a structural parameter, **not** as a result of signal-based excitation.

---

### II. Time as an Unjustified Coordinate

In all existing theories, time plays the role of an external parameter or geometric coordinate:

| Theory                  | Time is treated as...                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| General Relativity (GR) | A coordinate in the metric `g_{μν}`               |
| Quantum Mechanics (QM)  | An external parameter in the Schrödinger equation |
| Thermodynamics (TD)     | Direction of entropy growth                       |
| Cosmology               | Coordinate originating from singularity           |

But **none** of them realizes:



Signal ⇒ Δt



That is — time is **not triggered**, **not excited**, **not modeled as a response**.  
It is assumed, not generated.

---

### III. Causal Consequence: A Break in Logic

Mass and time are fundamental quantities, but:

- They are not linked to input actions;
- They do not result from any internal system logic;
- They cannot be excited through a signal.

> This violates the foundational principle of physics:  
> **Every change must have a cause.**

---

### IV. The Need for a New Model

To resolve the crisis, we need a model in which:

1. **Mass arises** from the match between signal and structure:



m = (E / c²) · f(S, B)



2. **Time is a reaction**:



Δt = 1 / (1 + λ·m + ρₛ)



3. **Coordinates** are not geometric, but reactive:



r⃗ = r₀ + ∫ v⃗(t) dt



4. The entire physical system is launched from a causal chain:



Signal(S)
→ Rule(S)
→ Block(B)
→ f(S, B)
→ Reaction(R)
⇒ {Δt, m, r⃗, E}





### V. Conclusion

Any physics that lacks a mechanism for triggering mass and time is incomplete.  
The absence of a **signal as the first cause** makes it a descriptive system — not a causal one.

The **Signal Theory of Being (STB)** introduces a fundamental **causal structure**, where physical quantities emerge as **reactions**, not assumptions.

> This closes the logical gap and opens the way to a formal physics of excitation.

---


---


## 1.2 The Goal of STB: A New Fundamental Picture of Reality

### I. Objective

The purpose of the **Signal Theory of Being (STB)** is to construct a **causally derivable model** of reality, in which physical quantities and structures are **not postulated**, but emerge as **reactions to a signal**.

This represents a shift from traditional formal physics to a **physics of excitation**, where:

- Mass `m`,
- Time `Δt`,
- Energy `E`,
- Coordinate `r⃗`,
- And the structure of space

are **results** of a signal–reaction process, not given input parameters.

---

### II. Core Principle

The entire physical system is expressed as a sequence of causally linked transformations:



Signal(S)
→ Rule(S)
→ Block(B)
→ f(S, B)
→ Reaction(R)
⇒ {Δt, m, r⃗, E}



Where:

- `S` — input signal (structured, with phase `ϕ`, energy `E`, direction, frequency),
- `B` — reactive block (field cell),
- `f(S, B)` — form-factor measuring match between signal and block,
- `R` — reaction: excitation, formation of mass, time, momentum, and secondary signals.

---

### III. Transforming Physical Foundations

STB reinterprets basic quantities as **derived outcomes**:

| Quantity   | In Traditional Theories                | In STB                                         |
|------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Mass `m`   | Fixed parameter                        | Reaction to signal: `m = (E / c²) · f`         |
| Time `t`   | Background coordinate                  | Delay of response: `Δt = 1 / (1 + λm + ρₛ)`    |
| Space      | Riemannian geometry                    | Topology of activated blocks                   |
| Energy `E` | A priori property                      | Density of phase and signal                    |

---

### IV. Formal Model Structure

STB replaces axioms with **excitation formulas**:

1. **Mass**:



m = (E / c²) · f(S, B)



2. **Local Time**:



Δt = 1 / (1 + λm + ρₛ)



3. **Coordinate (as reaction path)**:



r⃗ = r₀ + ∫ v⃗(t) dt



All these quantities are **products of local reactions**, not externally imposed values.

---

### V. Ultimate Goal

To formalize **reality as a system of responses**, not as a predefined configuration of objects.

STB is grounded in:

- Minimal assumptions,
- Maximum reactive determinism,
- A fundamental principle: **nothing exists without a signal**.

> If there is no signal — there is no mass, no time, no position.  
> All physical existence is a function of excitation — not of background.

---

### VI. Conclusion

The aim of STB is **not to complicate**, but to **simplify** the view of reality:

> To reduce all physical phenomena to the **dynamics of reaction**,  
> and all observables to **forms of signal-based excitation**.

STB does not replace classical theories — it provides a **foundation**  
from which they can be derived as **limiting cases of a universal causal logic**.


---


---


## 1.3 Comparison with GR, QM, QFT, and String Theory

### I. Methodological Shift

The **Signal Theory of Being (STB)** does not reject existing physical theories.  
Instead, it **reinterprets** them as subsystems within a broader **reactive paradigm**, in which:

- Equations are particular cases of signal-induced reactions,
- Objects are excited states,
- Physical laws are stable forms of reaction to structured input.

---

### II. Comparison Criteria

The distinction between STB and traditional theories can be summarized across five fundamental categories:

| Criterion     | Traditional Theories                          | Signal Theory of Being (STB)                              |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mass**      | Result of interaction with Higgs field        | Emerges via `m = (E / c²) · f(S, B)`                       |
| **Time**      | External or background parameter              | Local reactive delay: `Δt = 1 / (1 + λm + ρₛ)`             |
| **Space**     | Riemannian manifold                           | Topology of activated blocks                               |
| **Particle**  | Quantum excitation or string vibration        | Local block reaction to structured signal                  |
| **Field**     | Continuous value distribution in spacetime    | Grid of reactive blocks awaiting excitation                |

---

### III. General Relativity (GR)

- GR describes gravity as **curvature of spacetime** caused by mass-energy.
- In STB, mass itself arises from a **signal**.  
  Curvature is not fundamental, but a **reaction** to the spatial density of excited blocks.

> Space is not a predefined geometry in STB —  
> it **emerges dynamically** through signal–block interaction.

---

### IV. Quantum Mechanics (QM)

- In QM, particles exist in superpositions and are described by wave functions `Ψ`. Collapse occurs probabilistically upon observation.
- In STB, superposition corresponds to a **set of coexisting phase signals**.  
  Collapse is a deterministic **reaction of a block** when the form-factor exceeds threshold:



Ψ → ϕₖ when f(Sₖ, B) ≥ θ



> Collapse is not due to the observer — it is a **physical response to phase alignment**.

---

### V. Quantum Field Theory (QFT)

- QFT models particles as **field excitations**, and interactions as quantized exchanges.
- In STB:

  - Fields = **networks of potential blocks**,  
  - Particles = **cascade of local reactions**,  
  - Interaction = **signal propagation through structure**.

Examples:

- Photon → phase-only signal: `f = 0`
- Gluon → localized response within `SU(3)` block
- Fermion → partial match reaction of a block

> QFT becomes a special case of STB, under conditions of coherent excitation.

---

### VI. String Theory

- In string theory, fundamental particles are vibrational modes of strings in higher dimensions.
- In STB:

  - String = **signal with structured phase**,  
  - Extra dimensions = **phantom components of the signal**,  
  - Collapse occurs when the signal fully matches block:



f(S\_string, B) → 1 ⇒ mass becomes defined



> A "string" is not a physical thread but a **waveform that excites structure**.

---

### VII. STB's Generalizing Advantage

Rather than compete with classical theories, STB:

- Explains **why** they work under certain conditions,
- Provides the **underlying trigger mechanism**,
- Reconstructs them as **approximations** of the signal–reaction framework.

STB offers:

- **Causality** — every quantity must be excited,
- **Localization** — all dynamics are spatially bounded,
- **Scalability** — same model applies from Planck scale to cosmology,
- **Constructiveness** — clear criteria for when mass, time, and energy emerge.

---

### VIII. Conclusion

GR, QM, QFT, and String Theory are **descriptive models**.

STB is a **causal architecture** from which these models can be derived  
as special cases of a more **fundamental, signal-driven physical logic**.

> STB is not one more theory —  
> it is the structure beneath all of them.

## 1.4 The Role of Signal, Block, and Reaction

In the **Signal Theory of Being (STB)**, all physical phenomena are interpreted as **localized reactions** to signal inputs.  
Everything that manifests is a **consequence of a block reacting** to a structured signal.

At the core of the paradigm lie three irreducible elements:

---

### I. Signal (S)

A **signal** is the fundamental, indivisible carrier of excitation.  
It contains:

- Phase `ϕ`,
- Energy `E`,
- Direction vector `q⃗`,
- Frequency `ω`,
- Structural weight `w`.

It is defined mathematically as:



ρ(r⃗) = A · e^{iϕ(r⃗)}



> A signal is not embedded in space —  
> it **creates structure** through excitation.

---

### II. Block (B)

A **block** is a reactive entity — a minimal region capable of interpreting a signal and responding to it.

Each block is defined by:

- A resonance profile `ρ_B`,
- An activation threshold `θ`,
- A matching function: `f(S, B)`,
- A local reaction law.

The block reacts when:



f(S, B) ≥ θ



This match can be expressed as:



f(S, B) = | ∫ ρ\_S(r⃗) · ρ\_B\*(r⃗) dⁿr⃗ |


> The block is not “matter” — it is the **condition for realization**.

---

### III. Reaction (R)

A **reaction** occurs when the signal–block match exceeds threshold.  
It generates physical observables:

- Mass `m`,
- Time delay `Δt`,
- Coordinate `r⃗`,
- Emitted signal `S′`.

Formal outputs:



1. m  = (E / c²) · f(S, B)
2. Δt = 1 / (1 + λm + ρₛ)
3. r⃗  = r₀ + ∫ v⃗(t) dt
4. S′  = Modulate(S, R)



> The reaction defines what becomes **real** — it is the **event of manifestation**.

---

### IV. Functional Roles Overview

| Component | Role            | Resulting Action                                |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Signal    | Cause            | Carries information and excitation potential     |
| Block     | Condition        | Determines whether and how to react              |
| Reaction  | Consequence      | Physical realization of properties (m, Δt, r⃗)   |

---

### V. Ontological Perspective

STB eliminates the traditional “matter + field” duality.  
Instead, it builds reality from:

> **Signal → Block → Reaction**

There is no need for a predefined space, substance, or metric.

Reality is not a set of objects — it is a **network of triggered responses**.

---

### VI. Conclusion

In STB:

- A **signal** is the initiator,
- A **block** is the condition,
- A **reaction** is the act of becoming real.

This causal chain replaces static assumptions with a **universal mechanism of emergence**,  
defining all of physics as the logic of structured excitation.

---


---

## 1.5 How Signal Became the Foundation of Reality

### I. The Problem with Classical Foundations

Most existing physical theories begin from already-assumed entities:

- **Space** as a container,
- **Time** as a background coordinate,
- **Fields** as continuous distributions,
- **Particles** as localized excitations.

None of these elements explain **why** they exist — they are treated as givens, not consequences.

> STB asks a deeper question:  
> **What can exist without assumption of space, time, or geometry?**

---

### II. Signal as the Minimal Ontological Unit

STB identifies the **signal** as the only structure that can exist:

- Without a predefined metric,
- Without a background space,
- Without mass or time.

A signal is defined as a **structured phase excitation**:



ρ(r⃗) = A · e^{iϕ(r⃗)}



Where:

- `A` is amplitude (intensity),
- `ϕ(r⃗)` is phase structure,
- `ρ` is the signal field density.

> A signal **does not live in space** —  
> space **emerges from its propagation and reactions**.

---

### III. Pre-Spatial Logic of the Signal

In STB:

- Blocks exist in latent form,
- Space is not a geometric manifold, but a **network of possible excitations**.

When a signal is emitted:

1. It travels through the field of blocks,
2. Matches a local block with `f(S, B) ≥ θ`,
3. Triggers a **reaction**, creating mass, delay (time), and spatial coordinates.

> There is no space **before** the signal —  
> there is only **potential for reaction**.

---

### IV. Constructive Birth of the World

The entire structure of physical reality emerges from signal-based triggering:

1. A signal `S` forms (phase + energy),
2. It activates a block `B` when `f(S, B) ≥ θ`,
3. Reaction `R` defines:



m  = (E / c²) · f
Δt = 1 / (1 + λm + ρₛ)
r⃗  = r₀ + ∫ v⃗(t) dt



4. A new signal `S′` may be emitted → continuation of chain.

---

### V. Why Not Particle, Field, or Geometry?

| Concept     | Why It Fails as Foundation                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Particle    | Requires space, time, and mass a priori      |
| Field       | Needs a metric to define its continuity      |
| Geometry    | Implies coordinates and differentiability     |
| Time        | Only meaningful when delay or change occurs  |

Only the **signal** requires none of the above.  
It is **pure cause**, **pure excitation**, and **self-contained form**.

---

### VI. Principle of Emergence

The world arises not from presence, but from **propagation**.  
Not from placement, but from **activation**.

> Nothing exists until a signal makes it real.  
> Mass, time, and position are **not assumed — they are triggered**.

---

### VII. Conclusion

STB places the **signal** at the root of being.  
This is not a metaphor, but a strict architectural principle:

- A signal can exist in pre-geometry,
- It defines what becomes mass, time, and position,
- It is the first and only logical **starting point** of physics.

> The signal is not a messenger —  
> **it is the first act of reality itself**.

## 1.6 Novel Contributions of STB: Form Factor, π as Phase Threshold, and Physical Resolution of the Mass Gap

The **Signal Theory of Being (STB)** introduces a series of original concepts that expand the scope of physics and resolve long-standing foundational problems. These include:

- The **form factor** as a structural matching function,
- The reinterpretation of **π as a universal phase threshold**,
- A **constructive resolution of the mass gap** problem.

---

### I. The Form Factor `f(S, B)`

STB defines mass not as a predefined property, but as a function of the match between a signal and a reactive block.  
This match is quantified by the **form factor**:



f(S, B) = | ∫ ρ\_S(r⃗) · ρ\_B\*(r⃗) dⁿr⃗ |



Key properties:

- `f ∈ [0, 1]` is a normalized overlap,
- `f ≈ 0` → the block does not react (phantom),
- `f = 1` → full activation of mass and time.

The mass of a particle becomes:



m = (E / c²) · f(S, B)



> This formulation links mass directly to **signal–structure compatibility**,  
> introducing a physically computable alternative to the Higgs mechanism.

---

### II. π as a Universal Phase Threshold

STB proposes that **π** is not only a mathematical constant, but a **critical threshold** in physical systems.

Phase conditions:

- A signal can only activate a block if its **phase rotation** exceeds π.
- Reaction begins when:



∮ ∇ϕ · d⃗r ≥ π



This gives rise to a universal principle:

> No excitation → no reaction → no physics  
> unless the signal's phase structure crosses **π**.

π in STB:

- **Marks the border** between latent and real,
- Governs **activation, annihilation, and transition**,
- Appears in constructive definitions, not postulates.

---

### III. The Mass Gap as Phase Threshold

#### A. The Problem

In **Yang–Mills theory**, gauge fields (e.g., gluons) are massless, yet bound states (e.g., protons) exhibit mass.

This discrepancy — the **mass gap** — remains one of the **Millennium Problems** of physics.

#### B. STB Interpretation

In STB, the mass gap arises as a **threshold event**:

- The system accumulates **signal phase**,
- When it exceeds **π**, the block enters **excitation mode**,
- Mass appears as a result of **phase-activated structure**.

Constructively:



mass gap = minimum phase-integral needed to excite SU(N) lattice



This offers:

- A **physical origin** for the gap,
- A **calculable condition**,
- A connection between **quantized phase** and **mass emergence**.

---

### IV. Summary of Innovations

| Concept        | Role in STB                             | Key Formula or Condition                     |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Form Factor    | Signal–block match → determines mass     | `f(S, B)` + `m = (E / c²) · f`               |
| π Threshold    | Required for reaction to occur           | `∮ ∇ϕ · d⃗r ≥ π`                             |
| Mass Gap       | Phase-induced emergence in gauge fields  | Threshold-based excitation in SU(N) lattice  |

---

### V. Conclusion

The STB model:

- Replaces abstract postulates with **reaction mechanics**,
- Makes **mass** a computable, local result of signal geometry,
- Gives **π** a physical meaning as a critical point in phase evolution,
- Resolves the **mass gap** as a phase threshold phenomenon.

> These contributions elevate STB beyond interpretation —  
> they position it as a candidate for **constructive unification** in physics.
