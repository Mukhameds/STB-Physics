### **II. Signal Paradigm**

---

### **2.1. Basic Structure: Signal → Block → Reaction**

In the **Signal Theory of Being (STB)**, physical reality is not composed of inert particles or continuous fields, but arises from **reactive events** triggered by signals. The foundational triad is:


Signal → Block → Reaction


* **Signal** is the initiating carrier of reality. It possesses:

  * energy `E`,
  * phase `ϕ`,
  * structural pattern `q`,
  * weight `w`,
  * timestamp `t`.

  It is represented as a complex field:

  
  ρ_S(r⃗) = A · e^{iϕ(r⃗)}
  

  where `A` is the amplitude and `ϕ(r⃗)` the phase function.

* **Block** is a passive reactive unit in the ether. It contains:

  * a resonance form `ρ_B(r⃗)`,
  * a threshold of activation `θ`,
  * a local rule that defines whether the signal is strong and coherent enough to trigger a reaction.

  The block remains dormant until a matching signal arrives:

  
  f(S, B) ≥ θ  ⇒  Reaction
  

* **Reaction** is the moment of realization. It produces:

  * mass `m`,
  * local time delay `Δt`,
  * coordinate `r⃗`,
  * realized energy `E`,
  * and potentially a secondary signal `S′`.

> In STB, **reality is not given — it is triggered**. No reaction means no space, no time, no matter. Reality begins only when the signal matches the block.

### **2.2. Form Factor `f`: Measure of Match Between Signal and Block**

In STB, the **form factor** `f` quantifies how well the **signal** matches the **block** it interacts with. It is the core metric that determines whether a physical reaction occurs.

#### **Definition**

The form factor is defined as the normalized scalar overlap of the signal’s form with the resonance form of the block:


f(S, B) = | ∫ ρ_S(r⃗) · ρ_B*(r⃗) dⁿr⃗ |


Where:

* `ρ_S(r⃗) = A_S · e^{iϕ_S(r⃗)}` is the structure of the incoming signal,
* `ρ_B(r⃗) = A_B · e^{iϕ_B(r⃗)}` is the intrinsic resonance form of the block,
* `ρ_B*` is the complex conjugate of the block’s form.

#### **Interpretation**

* `f ∈ [0, 1]`

  * `f = 1`: perfect match → **maximum reaction**
  * `f = 0`: total mismatch → **no reaction** (phantom)
* Reaction condition:

  
  f ≥ θ
  

  where `θ` is the activation threshold of the block.

#### **Physical Meaning**

* `f` determines **if** the signal will be realized.
* It controls the **intensity** of the response — more matching → more mass, energy, coordinate localization.
* In contrast to probability amplitude in quantum mechanics, `f` is a **structural, phase-resonant metric**.

#### **Examples**

| Scenario                           | `f` value | Interpretation                          |
| ---------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Perfect structural-phase alignment | `f = 1.0` | Full realization, mass generated        |
| Partial phase or form mismatch     | `f = 0.4` | Weak or unstable excitation             |
| Antiphase (Δϕ = π)                 | `f ≈ 0`   | Destructive interference, no reaction   |
| High signal dispersion             | `f ≪ 1`   | Phantom signal, not physically realized |

> **Form factor** is the gatekeeper of reality: it determines whether a signal becomes mass, time, and energy — or remains a ghost.

### **2.3. Mass: m = (E / c²) · f**

In the Signal Theory of Being (STB), **mass is not a fundamental given**, but a result — an effect of **signal realization** through structural-phase resonance with a reactive block.

#### **Key Formula**

Mass is defined as:


m = (E / c²) · f(S, B)


Where:

* `E` — total energy of the signal;
* `c` — speed of light;
* `f(S, B)` — form factor, i.e., degree of match between the signal and the block.

#### **Implications**

* If `f = 1` → full realization → **maximum possible mass** from available energy.
* If `f ≈ 0` → mismatch → **no mass** arises (phantom signal).
* Mass becomes a **function of structural compatibility**, not of intrinsic particle identity.

#### **Contrasted with Standard Physics**

| Model          | Mass Origin                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Standard Model | Interaction with Higgs field (postulated) |
| STB            | Realization of signal through `f(S, B)`   |

Mass is thus not a substance, but **a quantized result of signal-block resonance**. It is *born*, not *assigned*.

> **No signal match → no mass. No resonance → no reality.**

### **2.4. Space: Structure of Excited Blocks**

In STB, **space is not a container**, background, or pre-existing stage.
It is a **dynamic structure**, defined as the set of blocks that have been **excited** by signals.

#### **Definition**

Space at time `t` is the set of all blocks `{Bᵢ}` for which the form factor exceeds the threshold:


Space(t) = { Bᵢ | f(S, Bᵢ) ≥ θ }


* There is no coordinate without excitation.
* There is no geometry without signal-block interaction.

#### **Core Principle**

> **Space = Activated Topology of Reaction**

Where traditional physics sees space as continuous and absolute, STB defines it as **reactive and discrete**.

#### **Consequences**

* Unexcited blocks ≡ non-existent regions.
* A signal that does not activate any block does not "exist in space."
* The extent of space **grows** with the propagation and realization of signals.

#### **Comparison**

| Classical Physics        | STB Interpretation                        |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Space exists a priori    | Space emerges from block activation       |
| Coordinates are absolute | Coordinates appear only upon excitation   |
| Geometry is fundamental  | Geometry is a consequence of signal paths |

> **In STB, no signal → no block → no space.**

### **2.5. Time: Delay of Field Response**

In STB, **time is not a universal background** or geometric coordinate.
Time arises **only when a signal is processed** by a reactive block.

#### **Definition**

Time `Δt` is the **local delay** between signal arrival and block response. It is given by:


Δt = 1 / (1 + λ·m + ρ_s)


Where:

* `λ` — sensitivity coefficient of the field,
* `m` — already excited mass in the block,
* `ρ_s` — local signal density (interference, saturation).

#### **Interpretation**

* **No signal → no time.**
* **Heavier blocks** and **denser environments** delay the response.
* **Empty ether (m = 0, ρ\_s = 0)** leads to `Δt = 1` — the fastest possible response.

#### **Comparison to Relativity**

| Concept                     | Classical / Relativistic | STB                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Time                        | Coordinate in spacetime  | Delay of excitation             |
| Gravitational time dilation | Curvature of metric      | Rise in `m` and `ρ_s`           |
| Time in vacuum              | Fixed, uniform           | Maximal response speed (`Δt=1`) |

#### **Key Insight**

> **Time is not flowing — it is reacting.**
> The more mass or signal load → the slower the response → the "slower" the local time.

### **2.6. Reaction: The Birth of Reality from Signal**

In STB, **reaction** is the fundamental event through which **reality emerges**.

No block reacts — no mass, no time, no position, no physics.

#### **Formal Chain**

A signal becomes physically real only if it satisfies:


Signal → Block[ρ_B, θ] → if f(S, B) ≥ θ → Reaction


And the **reaction** yields:


Reaction = {  
    m     = (E / c²) · f,        // mass  
    Δt    = 1 / (1 + λ·m + ρ_s), // local time  
    r⃗     = coordinate of the block,  
    E     = realized energy,  
    S′    = secondary signal(s)  
}


#### **What Is a Reaction in STB?**

* It is **not measurement**.
* It is **not collapse of probability**.
* It is **a physical event** where:

  * phase matches structure,
  * signal is accepted by the block,
  * and a transformation occurs: **signal becomes matter, energy, time**.

#### **Consequence**

> **Reaction is the act of creation.**
> Physics does not assume the existence of matter — it explains how it is created from the match between signal and structure.
