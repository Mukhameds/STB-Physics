### **V. Quantum Physics in STB**
---
#### **5.1. Wave Function Collapse as Block Excitation**
---
In classical quantum mechanics, the collapse of the wave function is a sudden transition from a superposition to a measured state, postulated without a physical mechanism. In the Signal Theory of Being (STB), collapse is not an abstract probability reduction, but a real excitation of a reactive block when the signal matches the block’s phase and structure.

> **STB Postulate**: *Collapse = structural-phase excitation of a reactive block by a matching signal.*

##### **STB Mechanism**:

* Let the quantum signal be $\rho_S(\vec{r}) = A e^{i\phi_S(\vec{r})}$
* Let the block have a structure $\rho_B(\vec{r})$
* Define the form factor as:

$$
f(S, B) = \left| \int \rho_S(\vec{r}) \cdot \rho_B^*(\vec{r}) \; d^n\vec{r} \right|
$$

* If $f(S, B) \geq \theta$, a reaction occurs.

This means that **the collapse occurs precisely when a signal's form and phase are sufficiently aligned with the block**, exceeding the activation threshold $\theta$.

##### **No Observer Needed**:

In STB, measurement is not caused by a conscious observer, but by:

* $\phi_S \geq \pi$: phase threshold condition
* $f(S, B) \geq \theta$: structural match
* $\rho_\phi > \rho_{\text{cr}}$: phase density above a critical level

##### **Result of Collapse**:

* A local realization: $m = \frac{E}{c^2} \cdot f$
* Emergence of local time: $\Delta t = \frac{1}{1 + \lambda m + \rho_s}$
* Generation of coordinates and secondary signal $S'$

##### **Example**:

Given a signal $\rho_S = e^{i\phi_1} + e^{i\phi_2}$, if the block resonates only with $\phi_2$, then:

* Only $\phi_2$ component causes excitation
* All other components remain phantom (unrealized)

##### **Conclusion**:

STB interprets wave function collapse as a **deterministic, signal-triggered realization** in phase-space, replacing observer-centric metaphysics with structural resonance.

> *Reality is not measured—it is excited.*

#### **5.2. Entanglement as a Multidimensional Signal**

In standard quantum mechanics, entanglement refers to the non-local correlation between particles, but the mechanism of connection remains obscure. In STB, entanglement is not a mysterious bond, but a manifestation of a **shared multidimensional signal**, whose phase structure simultaneously spans multiple reactive blocks.

> **STB Postulate**: _Entanglement = multidimensional phase integrity across spatially distributed blocks._

---

##### **Multidimensional Signal Structure**

A signal in STB may include both spatial and hidden dimensions:

\[
\rho(\vec{r}, \vec{\xi}) = A(\vec{r}, \vec{\xi}) \cdot e^{i\phi(\vec{r}, \vec{\xi})}
\]

Where:
- \( \vec{r} \) — spatial coordinates of blocks  
- \( \vec{\xi} \in \mathbb{R}^k \) — extra dimensions linking entangled parts  
- \( \phi(\vec{r}, \vec{\xi}) \) — the total phase shared across sites

---

##### **Mechanism of Entanglement**

Let blocks \( B_1 \) and \( B_2 \) be separated in space but embedded in a common signal:

\[
\rho = A \cdot e^{i\phi(\vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_2)}
\]

Then:
- Excitation in \( B_1 \) affects the phase seen by \( B_2 \)
- No signal is sent — the coherence is pre-existing

This **replaces action-at-a-distance with global phase continuity**.

---

##### **No Paradox**

- Bell/EPR experiments show correlation without transmission  
- STB interprets this as **non-fragmented phase topology**, not hidden variables

---

##### **Conditions for Entanglement**

Two blocks \( B_1 \) and \( B_2 \) are entangled if:

1. Their forms \( \rho_{B_1}, \rho_{B_2} \) match subcomponents of a shared \( \rho \)  
2. Excitation of one modifies \( \phi \) seen by the other: \( \delta\phi_{B_2} \neq 0 \)  
3. \( \vec{\xi} \)-space is the link; \( \vec{r} \)-space separation is irrelevant

---

##### **Entanglement Is Not Communication**

- No control signal propagates  
- Only excitation **within the shared phase** triggers reaction  
- Hence, no superluminal messaging — only **coherent realization**

---

##### **Conclusion**

Entanglement in STB is not spooky.  
It is **the coherence of a signal existing across multiple nodes**.

> _They don’t exchange information — they share a signal._

---
---

#### **5.3. The Uncertainty Principle: The Limit of Phase Overlap**

In classical quantum mechanics, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle states that certain pairs of physical variables — like position and momentum — cannot be simultaneously known with arbitrary precision. In STB, this limitation emerges from **the finite resolution of phase overlap** between the signal and the reactive block.

> **STB Postulate**: _Uncertainty = fundamental limit of phase alignment in simultaneous dimensions._

---

##### **Origin of Uncertainty in STB**

Let the signal be described as:

\[
\rho(\vec{r}) = A \cdot e^{i\phi(\vec{r})}
\]

And a block responds only if:

\[
f(\rho, B) = \left| \int \rho(\vec{r}) \cdot \rho_B^*(\vec{r}) \, d^n\vec{r} \right| \geq \theta
\]

The form factor depends on **phase coherence**. If two signals (or signal components) attempt to match **position and momentum simultaneously**, their phases become **mutually incompatible** — leading to interference and reduced overlap.

---

##### **Phase Geometry and Incompatibility**

In STB, position and momentum are encoded in **phase curvature** and **gradient direction**:

- Position: determined by the localized alignment of \( \phi(\vec{r}) \)
- Momentum: encoded in the phase gradient \( \nabla \phi(\vec{r}) \)

These quantities **cannot both be sharply defined** due to their Fourier-dual nature in phase space.

This gives rise to a minimal resolution constraint:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \gtrsim \frac{1}{f_{\text{max}}}
\]

Where \( f_{\text{max}} \) is the maximum achievable form factor under dual-phase excitation.

---

##### **Uncertainty as Overlap Limit**

The limit of simultaneous excitation is set by the overlap of phase structures:

\[
\text{Uncertainty} \Rightarrow \text{incomplete overlap in dual-phase domains}
\]

If two observables correspond to orthogonal or rapidly varying phases, then:

- Their mutual form factor \( f_{12} \to 0 \)
- No simultaneous excitation is possible
- Only **probabilistic emergence** remains (interpreted classically as uncertainty)

---

##### **Collapse Boundary**

Measurement collapses the phase to a definite realization in one domain (e.g., position), destroying its coherent structure in the conjugate domain (e.g., momentum).

Thus, uncertainty is not "lack of knowledge", but **a direct result of phase exclusion**.

---

##### **Conclusion**

STB reformulates the uncertainty principle as a **geometric incompatibility of phase alignment** in conjugate observables. The more sharply a signal aligns with one domain, the more it diffuses in its phase counterpart.

> _Uncertainty = signal’s impossibility to match multiple phase domains simultaneously._

---
---

#### **5.4. Wave Behavior = Phase Form**

In classical and quantum physics, the wave nature of particles is often treated as a probabilistic abstraction or interference effect. In the Signal Theory of Being (STB), **wave behavior is reinterpreted as the manifestation of a signal’s phase geometry**.

> **STB Postulate**: _Wave-like phenomena are the natural consequence of the structured form of phase \( \phi(\vec{r}, t) \)._

---

##### **Signal as a Phase Carrier**

Let the signal be:

\[
\rho(\vec{r}, t) = A(\vec{r}, t) \cdot e^{i\phi(\vec{r}, t)}
\]

- The amplitude \( A \) carries energy.
- The phase \( \phi \) determines direction, interference, coherence.
- The entire **wave behavior** arises from the evolution and shape of \( \phi \).

---

##### **Interference and Superposition**

Two signals \( \rho_1 = A_1 e^{i\phi_1} \), \( \rho_2 = A_2 e^{i\phi_2} \) superpose:

\[
\rho = \rho_1 + \rho_2 = A_1 e^{i\phi_1} + A_2 e^{i\phi_2}
\]

The result depends on **phase difference** \( \Delta\phi = \phi_1 - \phi_2 \):

- Constructive interference: \( \Delta\phi = 0 \)
- Destructive interference: \( \Delta\phi = \pi \)

These are **pure phase relations** — no amplitude interaction is needed.

---

##### **Phase as Geometry of Motion**

The evolution of the signal is governed by:

- \( \nabla\phi \): determines direction (analog of momentum)
- \( \partial\phi/\partial t \): determines energy or temporal behavior
- \( \nabla \times \nabla\phi \): determines wave-like curvature (e.g. magnetism)

Thus, **wave-like behavior** is simply the propagation of **phase curvature** in STB.

---

##### **Wavefront = Iso-phase Surface**

A surface \( \phi(\vec{r}) = \text{const} \) defines a **wavefront**.

- All points on this surface will reach the excitation threshold simultaneously
- The propagation speed is governed by the gradient \( \nabla\phi \)
- Shape of \( \phi \) determines diffraction, refraction, reflection

---

##### **From Phase to Observables**

Once a signal encounters a block:

- If \( f(\rho, B) \geq \theta \), a **reaction occurs**
- The phase pattern determines **where** and **how** this happens
- Thus, physical outcomes (e.g. positions on a screen) are **imprints of phase form**

---

##### **Conclusion**

In STB, wave behavior is not a metaphysical duality.  
It is **a structural result of phase architecture** of the signal.

> _Wave = geometry of phase; observation = projection of that geometry._

---
---

#### **5.5. Operators and Measurement as Signal Transformations**

In classical quantum mechanics, observables are represented by operators acting on wave functions. In STB, this concept is reinterpreted: **operators correspond to signal transformations**, and **measurement is the application of structural filters to extract phase-resonant components**.

> **STB Postulate**: _Operator = transformation of signal phase; Measurement = detection of block excitation post-transformation._

---

##### **Signal as Functional Carrier**

Let the signal be:

\[
\rho(\vec{r}) = A(\vec{r}) \cdot e^{i\phi(\vec{r})}
\]

In this context:

- \( A(\vec{r}) \): amplitude → energy carrier  
- \( \phi(\vec{r}) \): phase → structure, direction, symmetry  
- All physical quantities are encoded in phase structure

---

##### **Action of Operator**

In STB, an “operator” \( \hat{O} \) is defined as a signal-phase transformation:

\[
\hat{O} \rho(\vec{r}) = A(\vec{r}) \cdot e^{i\phi_O(\vec{r})}
\]

Where \( \phi_O(\vec{r}) = \mathcal{F}_O[\phi(\vec{r})] \) — transformation of phase via rule \( \mathcal{F}_O \)

Examples:
- Momentum operator → applies gradient shift to \( \phi \)
- Energy operator → applies time derivative to \( \phi \)
- Spin operator → rotates phase in internal (ξ) space

---

##### **Measurement as Resonant Projection**

A block \( B \) with structure \( \rho_B(\vec{r}) \) reacts only if:

\[
f(\hat{O} \rho, \rho_B) = \left| \int \hat{O} \rho(\vec{r}) \cdot \rho_B^*(\vec{r}) \, d^n\vec{r} \right| \geq \theta
\]

Thus:

- Measurement = applying \( \hat{O} \) to signal
- Followed by checking resonance with \( \rho_B \)
- Reaction = projection of signal into the operator’s phase image

---

##### **Eigenstates in STB**

In standard QM:

\[
\hat{O} \psi = \lambda \psi
\]

In STB, this becomes:

\[
\phi_O(\vec{r}) = \phi(\vec{r}) + \delta\phi \quad \text{where } \delta\phi = \text{const}
\Rightarrow \rho \text{ remains structurally invariant}
\]

That is, eigenstates are those **whose phase form remains aligned** after transformation — leading to consistent resonance with the block.

---

##### **Measurement Outcome**

If block excites after operator transformation:

- The result is **not a number**, but an **event of excitation**
- Observable value = derived from the **structure of phase** that caused excitation
- STB replaces numerical postulate with **form-driven outcome**

---

##### **Conclusion**

Operators in STB are **rules of phase modification**; measurement is not an abstract collapse, but **a physical test for structural match after transformation**.

> _To measure is to test resonance after phase deformation._

---
---

#### **5.6. Signal-Based Explanation of the Riemann Hypothesis**

The Riemann Hypothesis (RH) posits that all nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the critical line \( \text{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2} \). In STB, this is not treated as a purely mathematical abstraction, but as a phenomenon of **phase interference** in a signal superposition.

> **STB Postulate**: _Zeta zeros = points of total destructive interference of phase signals._

---

##### **Zeta Function as Signal Superposition**

The Riemann zeta function can be written as:

\[
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \rho_n(s), \quad \rho_n(s) = \frac{1}{n^\sigma} e^{-i t \ln n}
\]

Where:
- \( s = \sigma + i t \)
- \( \rho_n(s) \): each term is a **discrete phase signal** with amplitude \( \frac{1}{n^\sigma} \) and phase \( \phi_n = -t \ln n \)

Thus, \( \zeta(s) \) is a **coherent sum of phase-structured components**.

---

##### **Phase Cancellation and Zeros**

A zero of \( \zeta(s) \) occurs when:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \rho_n(s) = 0
\]

This represents a **complete phase collapse** — all signals destructively interfere such that the total amplitude vanishes.

- No block in STB can react to such a signal
- The signal becomes **purely phantom**
- No excitation → no reality → interpreted as a “zero”

---

##### **Why Only on the Critical Line**

Amplitude distribution:

\[
A_n = \frac{1}{n^\sigma}
\]

- For \( \sigma < \frac{1}{2} \): low-frequency modes dominate → unbalanced phase
- For \( \sigma > \frac{1}{2} \): high-frequency modes dominate → unstable interference
- Only at \( \sigma = \frac{1}{2} \): **perfect phase symmetry** across all \( n \)

This balance is required for **global destructive interference**.

---

##### **Physical Interpretation of RH in STB**

- RH is the condition under which the **signal structure self-annihilates**
- The zeros of \( \zeta(s) \) are **phantom nodes** — points where no excitation is possible
- The critical line is a **phase symmetry axis** for destructive interference

---

##### **Conclusion**

In STB, the Riemann Hypothesis becomes a statement about the **interferometric nulling of a global phase signal**:

> _Zeta zeros = nodes of absolute phantomization;  
> RH = symmetry condition for phase self-cancellation._

This reformulation makes RH not a mystery, but a **physical constraint of signal structure**.

\[
\boxed{
\zeta(s) = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \text{Phase collapse at } \text{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}
}
\]
